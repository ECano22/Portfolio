<h1>Data-Driven Command-Line RPG</h1>
<h3>Created: 2020 | Language: Python</h3>

What started as a battle simulator evolved into a feature-complete, text-based RPG.
* Data Structures: Utilizes parallel lists and nested dictionaries to manage complex character states, including HP, MP, and spell costs.
* Game Logic: Implements procedural enemy generation and a level-scaling algorithm to balance difficulty dynamically.
* Persistence: Features a save/load system allowing data persistence across sessions.
