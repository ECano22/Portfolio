This project was worked on back in the year 2020. Back then, all I knew about dungeons and dragons was that there was a lot of roleplaying and battles. I was wondering if there could possibly be a way to automate battles, and came up with this script as a solution. The final product turned out to be more like a turn based game in text. I remember having so much fun programming this that I worked on it for 7 hours, until 3 in the morning.
